# C_Data_Structure
A project in C implementing various sorting algorithms along with AVL trees and Hashing in chains. 
The algorithms are chosen with input by the user.
Given a dataset we implement on it the following algorithms to sort and use its data:
Insertion Sort,
QuickSort Sort,
Counting Sort,
Heap Sort,
Binary Search,
Interpolation Search,
Binary Interpolation Search
